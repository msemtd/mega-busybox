Plaything for interesting Arduino I/O controls.

Over the years I've collected quite a few interesting bits of hardware:
buttons, switches, indicators, and other inputs/outputs.

Rather than let them sit there gathering dust until I die, I've decided to put 
them all into a single, or perhaps two, meaningless but fully-functional control panels.
